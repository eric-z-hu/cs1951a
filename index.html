                <h1>Midterm Report: <small>&laquo;Reddit Analysis&raquo;</small></h1>
            </div>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Blah Blah Blah put stuff here
                An introduction that discusses the data you are analyzing, and the question or questions you are investigating. You should be able to explain what your data looks like (words are fine, but visualizations are often better).

                We are analyzing the Reddit comment dataset, which contains all the comments from every subreddit since the beginning of Reddit's creation. 
            </p>

      <h2>Visualization</h2>
            <p>
                Our visualization can be found <a href="visualization">here</a>. From the inception of our project idea, one thought had always been at the back of our minds: how diverse is Reddit? One who has spent any time reading YouTube comments might think that the Internet is full of trolls who only care about spreading profanity throughout the Internet. Another facet of Reddit that we have been wondering about is: how much has Reddit grown since its creation? One other hypothesis we wanted to test was how the most popular subreddits have changed over time.
            </p>

            <p>
                The visualzation allows users to look at the top 200 most popular subreddits throughout the history of reddit. It even includes subreddits that were banned. This data is interesting to us because it will allow us to put an extra dimension on our analysis. Instead of just returning Reddit's opinon about some topic, we can model how Reddit's opinon has fluctated over the years. We will hopefully be able to accurate model controversial social issues as well and see how opinions about them have changed as the years have gone by.
            </p>
            
      <h2>Machine Learning Result</h2>
            <p>
              We queried the data using BigQuery, google's cloud-based sql database hoster. We first queried which subreddits had the most instances of certain words, then found a random sample of comments in those subreddits containing those words. We then performed sentiment analysis using Python's NLTK. We used nltk.sentiment.vader and looked at the compound sentiment for each sentence in comments containing specific terms. We then used the karma of the comment (reddit's internal user-based scoring system) as a multiplier for each comment's sentiment value. Our results for a few topics for queries in the year 2012 are as follows:

              In addition to elucidating some of the general trends of subreddit opinion, which are generally expected (proving our sentiment analysis is at least somewhat accurate), we also get a glimpse into which subreddits are Reddit's chosen means of discussion. r/funny, which is supposedly used for posting humorous pictures or jokes, is one of the top subreddits when looking at terms such as atheism, obama, christian[ity], and religion. This reflects upon Reddit's culture--it is not meant as a serious news-reporting site, but rather a casual online forum intended to spark lively discussion through non-intimidating alleys. A cavalier attitude and open mind are critical assets for browsing.

              <br><br>
              We also see that Reddit, in general, is relatively positive. In all topics we queried, barring "terroris," most subreddits are, on the whole, displaying positive sentiment. This shows that Reddit, overall, upvotes and promotes comments that emote positive vibes, and rejects those with negative ones. This shows a general trend of respect. For example, we might expect a negative sentiment value for "christian" in the subreddit r/atheism. However, the sentiment value is, very slightly, positive. Similarly, "obama" receives a positive sentiment value in r/Libertarian and r/Conservative, in which subreddits this would not seem likely. Even when subreddits discuss topics users might not approve of, users still upvote comments with positive and respectful tones. 

              <br><br>
              These results help paint a picture of what discussion and opinion on Reddit were like in the year 2012. We are looking to do this for other years as well, and plot the general trend over time of popular opinion and language patterns.

      <h2>Discussion</h2>
            <p>
                The hardest part of the project we have encountered so far is being able to use all of the data. There is over a TB of data so it is impossible to analyze all of it on our local machines.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our initial insight is that Reddit is an extremely rich community of different minded people who will be sure to allow us to get many opinons on topics.
            </p>

            <p>
                Not yet, our final web applicaiton will depend on hosting all this data through AWS and allowing users to query it for different opinons about different things.
            </p>

            <p>
                The next big challenge we will have is setting up a remote server on AWS and loading our data on there, and also learning to use distributed machine learning tools.
