      <h2>Overview</h2>

                Blah Blah Blah put stuff here

      <h2>Visualization</h2>
            <p>
                Our visualization can be found <a href="visualization">here</a>. From the inception of our project idea, one thought had always been at the back of our minds: how diverse is Reddit? One who has spent any time reading YouTube comments might think that the Internet is full of trolls who only care about spreading profanity throughout the Internet. Another facet of Reddit that we have been wondering about is: how much has Reddit grown since its creation? One other hypothesis we wanted to test was how the most popular subreddits have changed over time.
            </p>

            <p>
                The visualzation allows users to look at the top 200 most popular subreddits throughout the history of reddit. It even includes subreddits that were banned. This data is interesting to us because it will allow us to put an extra dimension on our analysis. Instead of just returning Reddit's opinon about some topic, we can model how Reddit's opinon has fluctated over the years. We will hopefully be able to accurate model controversial social issues as well and see how opinions about them have changed as the years have gone by.
